<p>ASSIGNMENT WEEK 01
01.01 PRECEDENTS:
   
   01.01.01 UNCOVER GEOLOGY
                       --Artist/Designer: Thai Le
This is an excellent educational project. With the real physical model,learners can touch and feel. Instead of using mouse and 
trackpad, using hands is a more directly way to learn and understand things. 
But, with a virtual 3D model in computer, you can see the chance which you can not see in real world. 
Love the name: uncover geology. With this project, Geology is not a complex thing any more.
This project makes think of, using computer and tablet simplified human gestures and movement. In our daily life, we have to push,
to flip a book, to write different letters, to walk around and see something in different angle, but with a computer, we use mouse, 
we tab the keyboard, we move our fingers on trackpad. I don't know how this change will impact people, will people's mind turn into
a more flat type? Or It's good for people to image and keep on simplified our life? No answer.

    01.01.02 The Hyrtl Simulacrum
(Same elements were used in different project. Maybe they inspired each other.)
    
    
    
    
    01.01.02 Sensory Pathways for the Plastic Mind
                      --Artist/Designer:Aisen Caro Chacin
When I was in my high school, my Chinese teacher told us a new word“通感”, translated into english is "Synaesthesia".
“Synesthesia, is  a neurological condition in which stimulation of one sensory or cognitive pathway leads to automatic,involuntary
experiences in a second sensory or cognitive pathway.”------Wiki,"synesthesia"
Synesthesia usually happen in our brain, and hard to explain and describe. But this project, created a pathway, in physical world.
And these projects not only created pathways, but also trying to convert the human sense, from one to another. Her projects are a 
series based on a lot of research and exploration, and both different from each other.
"Play-a-Grill"  
This project is a bone conduction music player jewelry. As the first project in her series of projects（as I know）, I think, personally, this 
one more focus on "pathway", not Synesthesia. But it's still genius. She did a lot of research, and she find out that with vibrate, can pass music.
I feel it's hard to imagine how this music sounds like, because this is a totally new experience, and no one had ever feel it before. And, this kind of 
feeling is very personal thing, you can not share your sense feeling with others. It's like, you can see the grill, you can understand her concept, but
before you try it by yourself, you can never really get it. It's very mysterious, but also very practical.
"Scent Rhythm"
This one, unlike the "play-a-grill", create a pathway, from sense of smell to memory. I feel Aisen is playing careful attention to our daily life, and not
just stop at that point, she try to catch this flushing point, and spark them, connect them, make people see this point and notice. I noticed that smell can
recall my memory, but I never think about make a project with this kind of feeling. My feeling about smell, is when I smell a scent that I familiar with, it 
will recall my memory when I smell it last time, the surrounding, the people, the emotion. And what she did smartly, is she switch this "memory" to "time and 
schedule". The change of the scent become a alert, that remand you "it's time to do something!"
I'm also concerning a phenomenon here, which is, not like other senses, sense of smell is a one way trip. I mean, yes, people smell a scent and it will recall 
your memory, but, it's hard to describe, or remember a complex scent in your brain. (not simple scent, you can remember the smell of grass or soil or a flower,
but those mixed scents, especially those artificial scent and those perfume). Your brain blur the smell, and I feel like a white mist, no words to describe.
